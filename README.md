# 🤖 Agentic AI Workshop - PAK Angels & ICODEGURU

Welcome to the Agentic AI workshop repository! This session covers the fundamentals and advanced concepts of building intelligent agents using LangGraph and modern AI frameworks.

## 📚 Session Overview

This workshop introduces you to **Agentic AI** - autonomous systems that can make decisions, use tools, and complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention. You'll learn how to build sophisticated AI agents using LangGraph, a framework for creating stateful, multi-agent applications.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Understanding Agentic AI fundamentals
- Building agents with LangGraph
- Implementing workflows and decision-making logic
- Tool integration and function calling
- Creating multi-agent systems
- Practical implementations with n8n automation
